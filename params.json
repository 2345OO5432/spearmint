The game will be in `build/release-YOURPLATFORM-YOURARCH/`.\r\n* Copy your Quake III Arena pak[0-8].pk3 into `build/release-YOURPLATFORM-YOURARCH/baseq3`. (Don't own Q3? Buy it on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/433/).)\r\n* Create a textfile named `build/release-YOURPLATFORM-YOURARCH/baseq3/PAKSUMS`, put baseq3 text from [PAKSUMS](http://github.com/zturtleman/spearmint/wiki/PAKSUMS) in the file.\r\n* Run `build/release-YOURPLATFORM-YOURARCH/spearmint.YOURARCH`\r\n\r\nYou can add splitscreen players using the in-game menu after you start or join a server.\r\n\r\n### Running Quake III: Team Arena using Spearmint\r\n* Follow the steps for Quake III Arena above.\r\n* Copy your Quake III: Team Arena pak[0-3].pk3 into `build/release-YOURPLATFORM-YOURARCH/missionpack`. (Don't own Team Arena? Buy it on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/433/).)\r\n* Create a textfile named `build/release-YOURPLATFORM-YOURARCH/missionpack/PAKSUMS`, put missionpack text from [PAKSUMS](http://github.com/zturtleman/spearmint/wiki/PAKSUMS) in the file.\r\n* Run `build/release-YOURPLATFORM-YOURARCH/spearmint.YOURARCH` and choose Team Arena from the menu.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
