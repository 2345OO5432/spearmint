You can add splitscreen players after you start or join a server using the console (open/close using shift+esc or ~). 2dropin, 3dropin, and 4dropin commands add splitscreen players. 2dropout, 3dropout, and 4dropout commands remove splitscreen players. You'll need to manually bind controls, example `bind u +2forward` to have u move player 2 forward. Type `+2` then press tab to see full list.","google":"UA-45942785-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
