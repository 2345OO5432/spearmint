{"name":"Spearmint","tagline":"An extended Quake III Arena engine for creating standalone games.","body":"The intent of this project is to provide a version of ioquake3 which may be used for further development of standalone games.\r\n\r\nSome of the major features currently implemented are:\r\n\r\n- Four player splitscreen, offline and in network games.\r\n- Extended API for [Game](http://github.com/zturtleman/spearmint/wiki/Game%20API) and [CGame/UI](http://github.com/zturtleman/spearmint/wiki/CGame%20API), includes some of the features from RTCW, WolfET, Tremulous, World of Padman, and Turtle Arena.\r\n- Additional [shader](http://github.com/zturtleman/spearmint/wiki/Shaders) settings.\r\n- Merged UI VM into CGame VM, easier to modify and uses less resources.\r\n- Moved a lot of code from server and client to Game and CGame VMs; including [console](https://github.com/zturtleman/spearmint/blob/master/code/cgame/cg_console.c), chat input overlay, [usercmd_t creation](https://github.com/zturtleman/spearmint/blob/master/code/cgame/cg_input.c), and a lot of [bot AI code](https://github.com/zturtleman/spearmint/tree/master/code/game).\r\n- Removed code not needed for standalone games (CD Key handling, authentication server code, sending pk3 checksums to server, and PunkBuster UI code).\r\n- Ogg Opus, Ogg Vorbis, FreeType support enabled by default. Source and headers included in local source tree for easy compiling.\r\n\r\nRead more at the [Spearmint wiki](http://github.com/zturtleman/spearmint/wiki).\r\n\r\n## Running Quake III Arena using Spearmint\r\n* Get the source and compile it using make. The game will be in `build/release-YOURPLATFORM-YOURARCH/`.\r\n* Copy your Quake III Arena pak[0-8].pk3 into `build/release-YOURPLATFORM-YOURARCH/baseq3`. (Don't own Q3? Buy it on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/433/).)\r\n* Get the Spearmint Q3A patch files from [here](https://github.com/zturtleman/spearmint-patch-data) and put in `build/release-YOURPLATFORM-YOURARCH/baseq3/`\r\n* Run `build/release-YOURPLATFORM-YOURARCH/spearmint.YOURARCH`\r\n\r\nYou can add splitscreen players after you start or join a server using the in-game menu.\r\n\r\n## Running Quake III: Team Arena using Spearmint\r\n* Follow the steps for Quake III Arena above.\r\n* Copy your Quake III: Team Arena pak[0-3].pk3 into `build/release-YOURPLATFORM-YOURARCH/missionpack`. (Don't own Team Arena? Buy it on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/433/).)\r\n* Get the Spearmint Q3TA patch files from [here](https://github.com/zturtleman/spearmint-patch-data) and put in `build/release-YOURPLATFORM-YOURARCH/missionpack/`\r\n* Run `build/release-YOURPLATFORM-YOURARCH/spearmint.YOURARCH` and choose Team Arena from the menu.\r\n\r\nYou can add splitscreen players after you start or join a server using the console (open/close using shift+esc or ~). 2dropin, 3dropin, and 4dropin commands add splitscreen players. 2dropout, 3dropout, and 4dropout commands remove splitscreen players.","google":"UA-45942785-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
