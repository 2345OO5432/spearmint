Spearmint 0.1
March 13, 2015
--------------

Spearmint is a engine based on ioquake3 that is not compatible with (io)quake3 mods and demo replays.

Some of the many changes:

  * Four player splitscreen support.
  * Bullet marks on doors and moving platforms.
  * Gibs and bullet shells ride moving platforms.
  * Aspect correct wide screen FOV and HUD in Q3A.
  * Improved Bot AI.
  * Improved gamepad support.
  * Improved third person view.
  * Smooth corpse sinking.
  * Player shadow moves with animations.
  * PNG screenshots (with ext data containing map name and player origin, etc).
  * In multiplayer with gibs disabled, bodies no longer become invisible when gibbed.
  * Option to fade out explosion lights instead of shrinking them (set cg_fadeExplosions cvar to 1).
  * Many modding improvements (moved a lot of code into VMs, new API calls, new shader keywords, etc).

# How to play

To play Spearmint Quake 3, copy Quake 3's baseq3/pak[0-8].pk3 into the local baseq3 directory.
To play the Team Arena expansion, copy Quake 3 Team Arena's missionpack/pak[0-4].pk3 into the local missionpack directory.

If you don't own Quake 3 or Team Arena, they can be purchased on Steam. http://store.steampowered.com/sub/433/
Team Arena is not required to play Quake 3.

After copying the data, run spearmint_x86 or if using a 64-bit OS using spearmint_x86_64. On OSX, run the universal App Bundle.

Team Arena's UI does not support adding splitscreen players or setting their controls.


# Where do the saved files go?

All files are saved into the "settings" directory if it exists. It has been included so that this is a portable installation.

If the "settings" directory does not exist (i.e., you delete it) then a system path will be used.

  * Windows: \%APPDATA%\Spearmint\
  * Linux: /home/username/.spearmint/
  * OSX: /Users/username/Library/Application Support/Spearmint/


# Why aren't there any multiplayer servers showing up?

As of writing, there are no Spearmint Quake 3 dedicated servers running.
There is not a technical reason preventing dedicate servers from being run.


# What version of SDL is included?

SDL 2.0.3


# Game controllers

To enable a controller, go to controls -> player # -> joy -> select joystick.
Spearmint supports various controller mappings by default, but requires binding them in the controls menu (like keyboard keys).
If a controller's buttons cannot be bound in controls menu, it means that the controller mapping must be manually configured.
See gamepad-controls.txt for details.

settings/gamecontrollerdb.txt is a read-only file with additional controller mappings.
See https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB for details/updates.


# Renderer

Spearmint includes two renderers, opengl1 and opengl2. The default is opengl1.

The opengl2 renderer uses newer OpenGL features (OpenGL 2+) and is slower in many cases.
It's mostly on-par with opengl1, but may have some issues. There are various new features though.
See opengl2-readme.txt for details.

Open the in-game console by pressing "~" (the key left of 1 on US QWERTY layout) or shift+escape.
Type "com_renderer opengl2; vid_restart" and press enter. Switch back using
"com_renderer opengl1; vid_restart".
