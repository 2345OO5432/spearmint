# How to play

To play Spearmint Quake 3, copy Quake 3's baseq3/pak[0-8].pk3 into the local baseq3 directory.
To play the Team Arena expansion, copy Quake 3 Team Arena's missionpack/pak[0-4].pk3 into the local missionpack directory.

If you don't own Quake 3 or Team Arena, they can be purchased on Steam. http://store.steampowered.com/sub/433/
Team Arena is not required to play Quake 3.

After copying the data, run spearmint_x86 or if using a 64-bit OS using spearmint_x86_64. On OSX, run the universal App Bundle.

Team Arena's UI does not support adding splitscreen players or setting their controls.


# How to run a server

To run a dedicated internet server, open a terminal or command prompt and change to the directory containing Spearmint
and run "spearmint-server_x86 +set net_port 27960 +set sv_public 1 +set sv_pure 1 +set fs_game baseq3 +devmap q3dm17".
If you're running Spearmint on a device behind a NAT router, forward port 27960 (UDP) to the IP of the device running the server.

  * net_port defines the UDP-port used for connections to the server
  * fs_game should be the game you want to play
  * sv_pure 0 allows clients to use pk3-files not present on the server
  * sv_public 0 is LAN, 1 is Internet


# Where do the saved files go?

All files are saved into the "settings" directory if it exists. It has been included so that this is a portable installation.

If the "settings" directory is deleted then a system path will be used.

  * Windows: \%APPDATA%\Spearmint\
  * Linux: /home/username/.spearmint/
  * OSX: /Users/username/Library/Application Support/Spearmint/


# What version of SDL is included?

SDL 2.0.3


# Game controllers

To enable a controller, go to controls -> player # -> joy -> select joystick.
Spearmint supports various controller mappings by default, but requires binding them in the controls menu (like keyboard keys).
If a controller's buttons cannot be bound in controls menu, it means that the controller mapping must be manually configured.
See gamepad-controls.txt for details.

gamecontrollerdb.txt is a read-only file with additional controller mappings.
See https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB for details/updates.


# Renderer

Spearmint includes two renderers, opengl1 and opengl2. The default is opengl1.

The opengl2 renderer uses newer OpenGL features (OpenGL 2+) and is slower in many cases.
It's mostly on-par with opengl1, but may have some issues. There are various new features though.
See opengl2-readme.txt for details.

Open the in-game console by pressing "~" (the key left of 1 on US QWERTY layout) or shift+escape.
Type "com_renderer opengl2; vid_restart" and press enter. Switch back using
"com_renderer opengl1; vid_restart".
